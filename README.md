# IBM-ML-Project-Drinking-Water-Prediction

**Improved Source of Drinking Water ‚Äì AI Prediction using IBM Cloud**

This project leverages **IBM Watsonx** and **IBM Cloud Lite AI tools** to predict access to improved sources of drinking water across various Indian regions using survey data from the **AI Kosh 78th Round dataset**.

The system helps identify **underserved rural and urban areas**, supporting **data-driven planning** and interventions aligned with **Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water & Sanitation**.



## Technologies Used

* IBM Watsonx
* IBM Cloud Lite Services
* AI Kosh Dataset




## Features

* Predicts regions with low access to improved drinking water.
* Enables government & NGO resource planning.
* Applies machine learning for high prediction accuracy.
* Handles data imbalance with preprocessing techniques.
* Can be extended with IoT sensor data for real-time insights.
